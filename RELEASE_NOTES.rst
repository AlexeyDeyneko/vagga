Release Notes
=============


Vagga 0.2.5
===========

:Release Date: 03.03.2015

* A quick bugfix release of NpmInstall command


Vagga 0.2.4
===========

:Release Date: 03.03.2015

* Implement support of ``https`` links for Tar, TarInstall commands
* The ``!Py*`` commands now download latest pip via `get-pip.py`_. This
  effectively means (a) that new features (like checkout a git subdirectory)
  works, (b) the version of pip is uniform across distributions and
  (c) installing dependencies to not interfere with pip dependencies on ubuntu
  (e.g. previously requests library where removed when removing build
  dependencies)
* Fix ``!CacheDirs`` command which was broken few versions ago
* Add ``!Text`` command for easier writing files into container (e.g. configs)

.. _get-pip.py: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html


Vagga 0.2.3
===========

:Release Date: 19.02.2015

* Reasonable error message when not enough uids available (#7)
* When running as root vagga now can use all available uids and doesn't require
  subuid/subgid files setup, mostly useful for container-in-container
  scenarios (#7)
* The ``VAGGAENV_*`` environment vars will now be propagated to containers with
  the prefix stripped
* vagga now supports ``--env`` and ``--use-env`` command-line switch to set
  envionment variable for child processes and to propagate a variable from
  parent (i.e. user's) environment
* Add ``!Container`` build command, which may be used to build on top of
  another container
* The ``vagga _run`` now works with relative commands
* Experimantal ``auto-clean`` option for containers
* Add ``node-legacy`` as dependency of ``!Npm`` for ubuntu (required for many
  scripts)


Vagga 0.2.2
===========

:Release Date: 14.02.2015

* Add ``_version_hash`` command, mostly for scripting
* No need for tilde or null after ``!UbuntuUniverse`` (and probably other cases)
* Fix permission of ubuntu ``policy-rc.d``, which fixes installing packages
  having a daemon that start on install
* Configure apt to always use ``--no-install-recommends`` in ubuntu
* Add ``-W`` flag to ``_run`` command, to run writable (copy of) container
* Ubuntu will automatically use nearest mirror and allow to customize mirror
  in personal settings


Vagga 0.2.1
===========

:Release Date: 12.02.2015

This release fixes small issues appeared right after release and adds python
requirements.txt support.

* ``make install`` did not install vagga's busybox, effectively making vagga
  work only from source folder
* Add Py2Requirements and Py3Requirements
  `commands <http://vagga.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build_commands.html#pyreq>`_
* Implement writing ``/etc/resolv.conf`` (previously worked only by the fact
  that libc tries 127.0.0.1 when the file is empty)
* Fix positional arguments for shell-wrapped commands


Vagga 0.2.0
===========


:Release Date: 11.02.2015

This is backwards-incompatible release of vagga. See Upgrading_. The need for
changes in configuration format is dictated by the following:

* Better isolation of build process from host system
* More flexible build steps (i.e. don't fall back to shell scripting for
  everything beyond "install this package")
* Caching for all downloads and packages systems (not only for OS-level
  packages but also for packages installed by pip and npm)
* Deep dependency tracking (in future version we will not only track
  changes of dependencies in ``vagga.yaml`` but also in ``requirements.txt``
  and ``package.json`` or whatever convention exists; it's partially possible
  using Depends_ build step)

More features:

* Built by Rust ``1.0.0-alpha``
* Includes experimental network_ `testing tools`_


There are `some features missing`_, but we believe it doesn't
affect a lot of users.
