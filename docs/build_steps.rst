Build Steps
===========

This is work in progress reference of build steps. See :ref:`build_commands`
for help until this document is done. There is also an alphabetic
:ref:`genindex`

All of the following build steps may be used as an item in :opt:`setup`
setting.


Container Bootstrap
===================

Command that can be used to bootstrap a container (i.e. may work on top
of empty container):

* :step:`Alpine`
* :step:`Ubuntu`
* :step:`UbuntuRelease`
* :step:`SubConfig`
* :step:`Container`
* :step:`Tar`

Ubuntu Commands
===============

.. step:: Ubuntu

   Simple and straightforward way to install Ubuntu LTS release.

   Example::

       setup:
       - !Ubuntu trusty

   The value is single string having the codename of release ``trusty`` or
   ``precise`` known to work at the time of writing.

   The Ubuntu LTS images are updated on daily basis. But vagga downloads and
   caches the image. To update the image that was downloaded by vagga you need
   to clean the cache.

.. step:: UbuntuRelease

   This is more exensible but more cumbersome way to setup ubuntu (comparing
   to :step:`Ubuntu`). For example to install trusty you need::

   - !UbuntuRelease { version: 14.04 }

   But you can install non-lts version with this command::

   - !UbuntuRelease { version: 15.10 }

   All options:

   version
     The verison of ubuntu to install. This must be digital ``YY.MM`` form,
     not a code name. **Required**.

   keep-chfn-command
     (default ``false``) This may be set to ``true`` to enable
     ``/usr/bin/chfn`` command in the container. This often doesn't work on
     different host systems (see `#52
     <https://github.com/tailhook/vagga/issues/52>`_ as an example). The
     command is very rarely useful, so the option here is for completeness
     only.


.. step:: AptTrust

   This command fetches keys with ``apt-key`` and adds them to trusted keychain
   for package signatures. The following trusts a key for ``fkrull/deadsnakes``
   repository::

       - !AptTrust keys: [5BB92C09DB82666C]

   By default this uses ``keyserver.ubuntu.com``, but you can specify
   alternative::

       - !AptTrust
         server: hkp://pgp.mit.edu
         keys: 1572C52609D

   This is used to get rid of the error similar to the following::

        WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
          libpython3.5-minimal python3.5-minimal libpython3.5-stdlib python3.5
        E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes

   Options:

   server
     (default ``keyserver.ubuntu.com``) Server to fetch keys from. May be
     a hostname or ``hkp://hostname:port`` form. Or actu

   keys
     (default ``[]``) List of keys to fetch and add to trusted keyring. Keys
     can include full fingerprint or **suffix** of the fingerprint. The most
     common is 8 hex digits form.

.. step:: UbuntuRepo

   Adds arbitrary debian repo to ubuntu configuration. For example to add
   newer python::

       - !UbuntuRepo
         url: http://ppa.launchpad.net/fkrull/deadsnakes/ubuntu
         suite: trusty
         components: [main]
       - !Install [python3.5]

   See :step:`UbuntuPPA` for easier way for dealing specifically with PPAs.

   Options:

   url
     Url to the repository. **Required**.

   suite
     Suite of the repository. The common practice is that suite is named just
     like codename of the ubuntu release. For example ``trusty``. **Required**.

   components
     List of the components to fetch packages from. Common practice to have a
     ``main`` component. So usually this setting contains just single
     element ``components: [main]``. **Required**.

.. step:: UbuntuPPA

   A shortcut to :step:`UbuntuRepo` that adds named PPA. For example, the
   following::

       - !Ubuntu trusty
       - !AptTrust keys: [5BB92C09DB82666C]
       - !UbuntuPPA fkrull/deadsnakes
       - !Install [python3.5]

   Is equivalent to::

       - !Ubuntu trusty
       - !UbuntuRepo
         url: http://ppa.launchpad.net/fkrull/deadsnakes/ubuntu
         suite: trusty
         components: [main]
       - !Install [python3.5]

.. step:: UbuntuUniverse

   The singleton step. Just enables an "universe" repository::

   - !Ubuntu trusty
   - !UbuntuUniverse
   - !Install [checkinstall]


Alpine Commands
===============

.. step:: Alpine


Distribution Commands
=====================

These commands work for any linux distributions as long as distribution is
detected by vagga. Latter basically means you used :step:`Alpine`,
:step:`Ubuntu`, :step:`UbuntuRelease` in container config (or in parent
config if you use :step:`SubConfig` or :step:`Container`)

.. step:: Install

.. step:: BuildDeps


Generic Commands
================

.. step:: Sh

.. step:: Cmd

.. step:: Tar

.. step:: TarInstall

.. step:: Git

.. step:: GitInstall



Files and Directories
=====================

.. step:: Text

.. step:: Remove

.. step:: EnsureDir

.. step:: EmptyDir

.. step:: CacheDirs


Meta Data
=========

.. step:: Env

.. step:: Depends


Sub-Containers
==============

.. step:: Container

.. step:: SubConfig


Node.JS Commands
================

.. step:: NpmInstall


Python Commands
===============

.. step:: PipConfig

   The directive configures various settings of pythonic commands below. The
   mostly used option is ``dependencies``::

       - !PipConfig
           dependencies: true
       - !Py3Install [flask]

   Most options directly correspond to the pip command line options so refer to
   `pip help`_ for more info.

   All options:

   dependencies
       (default ``false``) allow to install dependencies. If the option is
       ``false`` (by default) pip is run with ``pip --no-deps``

   index-urls
       (default ``[]``) List of indexes to search for packages. This
       corresponds to ``--index-url`` (for the first element) and
       ``--extra-index-url`` (for all subsequent elements) options on the
       pip command-line.

       When the list is empty (default) the ``pypi.python.org`` is used.

   find-links
       (default ``[]``) List of urls to html files to parse for links to
       packages for download.

   trusted-hosts
       (default ``[]``) List of hosts that are trusted to download packages
       from.

   cache-wheels
       (default ``true``) Cache wheels between different rebuilds of the
       container. The downloads are always cached. Only binary wheels are
       toggled with the option. It's useful to turn this off if you build
       many containers with different dependencies.

       Starting with vagga v0.4.1 cache is namespaced by linux distribution and
       version. It was single shared cache in vagga <= v0.4.0
