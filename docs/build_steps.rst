Build Steps
===========

This is work in progress reference of build steps. See :ref:`build_commands`
for help until this document is done.

All of the following build steps may be used as an item in :opt:`setup`
setting.


Container Bootstrap
===================

Command that can be used to bootstrap a container (i.e. may work on top
of empty container):

* :step:`Alpine`
* :step:`Ubuntu`
* :step:`UbuntuRelease`
* :step:`SubConfig`
* :step:`Container`
* :step:`Tar`

Ubuntu Commands
===============

.. step:: Ubuntu

   Simple and straightforward way to install Ubuntu LTS release.

   Example::

       setup:
       - !Ubuntu trusty

   The value is single string having the codename of release ``trusty`` or
   ``precise`` known to work at the time of writing.

   The Ubuntu LTS images are updated on daily basis. But vagga downloads and
   caches the image. To update the image that was downloaded by vagga you need
   to clean the cache.

.. step:: UbuntuRelease

.. step:: UbuntuRepo

.. step:: UbuntuUniverse


Alpine Commands
===============

.. step:: Alpine


Distribution Commands
=====================

These commands work for any linux distributions as long as distribution is
detected by vagga. Latter basically means you used :step:`Alpine`,
:step:`Ubuntu`, :step:`UbuntuRelease` in container config (or in parent
config if you use :step:`SubConfig` or :step:`Container`)

.. step:: Install

.. step:: BuildDeps


Generic Commands
================

.. step:: Sh

.. step:: Cmd

.. step:: Tar

.. step:: TarInstall

.. step:: Git

.. step:: GitInstall



Files and Directories
=====================

.. step:: Text

.. step:: Remove

.. step:: EnsureDir

.. step:: EmptyDir

.. step:: CacheDirs


Meta Data
=========

.. step:: Env

.. step:: Depends


Sub-Containers
==============

.. step:: Container

.. step:: SubConfig


Node.JS Commands
================

.. step:: NpmInstall


Python Commands
===============

.. step:: PipConfig

   The directive configures various settings of pythonic commands below. The
   mostly used option is ``dependencies``::

       - !PipConfig
           dependencies: true
       - !Py3Install [flask]

   Most options directly correspond to the pip command line options so refer to
   `pip help`_ for more info.

   All options:

   dependencies
       (default ``false``) allow to install dependencies. If the option is
       ``false`` (by default) pip is run with ``pip --no-deps``

   index-urls
       (default ``[]``) List of indexes to search for packages. This
       corresponds to ``--index-url`` (for the first element) and
       ``--extra-index-url`` (for all subsequent elements) options on the
       pip command-line.

       When the list is empty (default) the ``pypi.python.org`` is used.

   find-links
       (default ``[]``) List of urls to html files to parse for links to
       packages for download.

   trusted-hosts
       (default ``[]``) List of hosts that are trusted to download packages
       from.

   cache-wheels
       (default ``true``) Cache wheels between different rebuilds of the
       container. The downloads are always cached. Only binary wheels are
       toggled with the option. It's useful to turn this off if you build
       many containers with different dependencies.

       Starting with vagga v0.4.1 cache is namespaced by linux distribution and
       version. It was single shared cache in vagga <= v0.4.0
