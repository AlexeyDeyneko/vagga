Commands
========


Every command under ``commands`` in ``vagga.yaml`` is mapped with a tag
that denotes the command type. The are two command types ``!Command``
and ``!Supervise`` illustrated by the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    containers: {ubuntu: ... }
    commands:
      bash: !Command
        description: Run bash shell inside the container
        container: ubuntu
        run: /bin/bash
      download: !Supervise
        description: Download two files simultaneously
        children:
          amd64: !Command
            container: ubuntu
            run: wget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/trusty/daily/current/trusty-core-amd64.tar.gz
          i386: !Command
            container: ubuntu
            run: wget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/trusty/daily/current/trusty-core-i386.tar.gz


Common Parameters
=================

These parameters work for both kinds of commands:


.. opt:: description

   Description that is printed in when vagga is run without arguments

.. opt:: banner

   The message that is printed before running process(es). Useful for
   documenting command behavior.

.. opt:: banner-delay

   The seconds to sleep before printing banner. For example if commands run
   a web service, banner may provide a URL for accessing the service. The
   delay is used so that banner is printed after service startup messages not
   before.  Note that currently vagga sleeps this amount of seconds even
   if service is failed immediately.

.. opt:: epilog

   The message printed after command is run. It's printed only if command
   returned zero exit status. Useful to print further instructions, e.g. to
   display names of build artifacts produced by command.


Parameters of `!Command`
========================

.. opt:: container

   The container to run command in

.. opt:: run

   The command to run. It's either a string (which is passed to
   ``/bin/sh -c``) or a list of command and arguments.

.. opt:: work-dir

   The working directory to run in. Path relative to project root. By
   default command is run in the same directory where vagga started (sans
   the it's mounted as ``/work`` so the output of ``pwd`` would seem to be
   different)

.. opt:: accepts-arguments

   Denotes whether command accepts additional arguments. Defaults to ``false``
   for shell commands, and ``true`` for regular commands.

.. opt:: environ

   The mapping of environment to pass to command. This overrides environment
   specified in container on value by value basis.

.. opt:: pid1mode

   This denotes what is run as pid 1 in container. It may be ``wait``,
   ``wait-all-children`` or ``exec``. The default ``wait`` is ok for most
   regular processes. See :ref:`pid1mode` for more info.

.. opt:: write-mode

   The parameter specifies how container's base file system is used. By
   default container is immutable (corresponds to the ``read-only`` value of
   the parameter), which means you can only write to the ``/tmp`` or
   to the ``/work`` (which is your project directory).

   Another option is ``transient-hard-link-copy``, which means that whenever
   command is run, create a copy of the container, consisting of hard-links to
   the original files, and remove the container after running command. Should
   be used with care as hard-linking doesn't prevent original files to be
   modified. Still very useful to try package installation in the system. Use
   ``vagga _build --force container_name`` to fix base container if that was
   modified.

.. opt:: user-id

   The user id to run command as. If the ``external-user-id`` is omitted this
   has same effect like using ``sudo -u`` inside container (except it's user
   id instead of user name)

.. opt:: external-user-id

   **(experimental)** This option allows to map the ``user-id`` as seen by
   command itself to some other user id inside container namespace (the
   namespace which is used to build container). To make things a little less
   confusing, the following two configuration lines::

       user-id: 1
       external-user-id: 0

   Will make your command run as user id 1 visible inside the container
   (which is "daemon" or "bin" depending on distribution). But outside the
   container it will be visible as your user (i.e. user running vagga). Which
   effectively means you can create/modify files in project directory without
   permission errors, but ``tar`` and other commands which have different
   behaviour when running as root would think they are not root (but has
   user id 1)


Parameters of `!Supervise`
==========================

.. opt:: mode

   The set of processes to supervise and mode. See :ref:`supervision` for more
   info

.. opt:: children

   A mapping of name to child definition of children to run. All children are
   started simultaneously.

.. opt:: kill-unresponsive-after

   (default `2` seconds) If some process exits (in ``stop-on-failure``
   mode), vagga will send TERM signal to all the other processes. If they don't
   finish in the specified number of seconds, vagga will kill them with KILL
   signal (so they finish without being able to intercept signal
   unconditionally). If you don't like this behavior set the parameter to
   some large value.
