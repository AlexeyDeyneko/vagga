What's Special With Pid 1?
==========================


The first process started by the linux kernel gets PID 1. Similarly when new
PID namespace is created first process started in that namespace gets PID 1
(the PID as seen by the processes in that namespace, in parent namespace it
gets assigned other PID).

The process with PID 1 differ from other processes in the following ways

* When the process with pid 1 die for any reason, all other processes are
  killed with ``KILL`` signal
* When any process having children dies for any reason, its children are
  reparented to process with PID 1
* Many signals which have default action of ``Term`` do not have one for PID 1.

I may look like the most disruping one is first. But in practice most
inconvenient one for development purposes is the last one, because, effectively
you can't stop process by sending ``SIGTERM`` or ``SIGINT``, if process have
not installed a singal handler.

At the end of the day all above means most processes that where not explicitly
designed to run as PID 1 (which are all applicactions except supervisors), do
not run well. Vagga fixes that by not running process as PID 1.

In fact there are three modes of operation of PID 1 supported by vagga (set by
``pid1mode`` parameter in :ref:`command configuration <commands>`):

* ``wait`` -- (default) run command (usually it gets PID 2) and wait until it
  exits
* ``wait-all-children`` -- run command, then wait all processes in namespace to
  finish
* ``exec`` -- run the command as PID 1, useful only if command itself is
  process supervisor like upstart_, systemd_ or supervisord_

Note that in ``wait`` and ``exec`` modes, when you kill vagga itself with a
signal, it will propagate the signal to the command itself. In
``wait-all-children`` mode, signal will be propagated to all processes in the
container (even if it's some supplementary command run as a child of some
intermediary process). This is rarely the problem.
