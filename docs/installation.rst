Installation

Runtime Dependencies
====================

Vagga is compiled as static binary, so it doesn't have many runtime
dependencies. It does require user namespaces to be properly set up, which
allows Vagga to create and administer containers without having root privlege.
This is increasingly available in modern distributions but may need to be
enabled manually.

* the ``newuidmap``, ``newgidmap`` binaries are required (either from
  ``shadow`` or ``uidmap`` package)

* known exception for Archlinux: ensure ``CONFIG_USER_NS=y`` enabled in kernel.

* known exception for Debian and Fedora: some distributions disable
  unprivileged user namespaces by default. You can check with::

    $ sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1

  and to enable::

    $ sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1
    # make available on reboot
    $ echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1 | \
        sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/50-unprivleged-userns-clone.conf
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1

* ``/etc/subuid`` and ``/etc/subgid`` should be set up. Usually you need at
  least 65536 subusers. This will be setup automatically by ``useradd`` in new
  distributions.  See ``man /etc/subuid`` if not. To check::

    $ grep -w $(whoami) /etc/sub[ug]id
    /etc/subgid:<you>:689824:65536
    /etc/subuid:<you>:689824:65536

The only other optional dependency is ``iptables`` in case you will be doing
:doc:`network tolerance testing</network>`.

See instructions specific for your distribution below.

Building From Source
====================

.. note:: The recommended way to building vagga is to install the tool from
   packages (see :ref:`Ubuntu` below and then build vagga using vagga itself,
   the text below describes old-style build process)


Build-time dependencies:

* Rust_ compiler 1.0.0-alpha (``rustc``)
* ``make`` (probably gnu variant)
* ``git`` (when installing from git source)

Run-time dependencies (basically none):

* ``glibc`` (probably you have it)
* ``newuidmap/newgidmap`` binaries (in ubuntu is separate ``uidmap`` package,
  but it's a part of ``shadow`` which is installed everywhere)

Process is as simple as following::

    git submodule update --init
    make
    sudo make install PREFIX=/usr


.. _Rust: http://rust.org
.. _linux: http://kernel.org

.. _ubuntu:

Ubuntu
======

To install from vagga's repository just add the following to `sources.list`::

    deb http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga main

The process of installation looks like the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo 'deb http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vagga.list
    deb http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga main
    $ sudo apt-get update
    [.. snip ..]
    Get:10 http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga/main amd64 Packages [365 B]

Now vagga is ready to go.

.. note:: If you are courageous enough, you may try to use ``vagga-testing``
   repository to get new versions faster::

       deb http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga-testing main

   It's build right from git "master" branch and we are trying to keep "master"
   branch stable.

Ubuntu: Old Releases (precise, 12.04)
=====================================

For old ubuntu you need `uidmap`. It has no dependencies. So if your
ubuntu release doesn't have `uidmap` package (as 12.04 does), just fetch it
from newer ubuntu release::

    wget http://gr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/shadow/uidmap_4.1.5.1-1ubuntu9_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i uidmap_4.1.5.1-1ubuntu9_amd64.deb

Then run same sequence of commands, you run for more recent releases:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo 'deb http://ubuntu.zerogw.com vagga main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vagga.list
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install vagga

If your ubuntu is older, or you upgraded it without recreating a user, you
need to fill in ``/etc/subuid`` and ``/etc/subgid``. Command should be similar
to the following::

    echo "$(id -un):100000:65536" | sudo tee /etc/subuid
    echo "$(id -un):100000:65536" | sudo tee /etc/subgid

Or alternatively you may edit files by hand.

Now your vagga is ready to go.


Ubuntu: Building From Source
============================

Until rust is stable and added to ubuntu repository you need to fetch it from
rust-lang.org::

    wget https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.0.0-alpha-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    tar -xf rust-1.0.0-alpha-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    cd rust-1.0.0-alpha-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    ./install.sh --prefix=/usr

Building vagga::

    git clone git://github.com/tailhook/vagga
    cd vagga
    git submodule update --init
    make

Installing::

    sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

For upgrading you may build vagga using vagga, just run the following in source
directory of vagga::

    vagga build-ubuntu-package

It will put ``*.deb`` file in current directory.
