Vagga
=====


Vagga is a fully-userspace container engine inspired by Vagrant_ and Docker_,
mainly used for development environments.

:Status: beta

Mayor Features Are:

* Running programs in linux containers (not a full virtualization like Vagrant)
* Fully userspace containers, no need for elevated privileges like for Docker_
* Runs containerized process as a child of current shell, no attach/detach hell
* Images are automatically rebuilt and versioned
* Vagga has tools to manage trees of processes (so you run your
  redis-python-nginx server with one command)
* Partial compatibility with `Vagrant-LXC` and Docker_ (pretty limited so far)
